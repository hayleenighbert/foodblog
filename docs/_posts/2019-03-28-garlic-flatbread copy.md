One of my favorite things to make for a snack when I'm in a hurry are flatbreads. You can throw 2-3 main ingredients together and make something really wonderful, regardless of simplicity.

The combination of pear, red onion, and balsamic reduction makes for a sweet and savory combination that's out of this world.
