One of my favorite things to make for a snack when I'm in a hurry are flatbreads. You can throw 2-3 main ingredients together and make something really wonderful.

The combination of pear, red onion, and balsamic reduction makes for a sweet and savory combination that's out of this world.

## Ingredients

* Garlic or traditional Naan bread (you can usually find it in the bakery)
* Pizza sauce (homemade or store-bought)
* Italian herbs like oregano, rosemary, thyme, parsley, and basil. Better if fresh!
* 1 tbsp Nutritional Yeast, or grated parmesan if you aren't Vegan/Lactose intolerant.
* 1 Bartlett Pear, more ripe the better.
* 1 cup of balsamic vinegar.
* 1 tbsp brown sugar.


## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 F.
2. Start the balsamic reduction. Put 1 cup of balsamic vinegar in a sauce pan and cook on medium-low. When it starts to thicken, add 1 tbsp brown sugar and a pinch of salt to the glaze. Stir constantly so it doesn't burn and cook for about 10-15 minutes. Set aside glaze.
3. Slice the bear into very thin slices. In the same sauce pan, slightly brown the pear slices in the residual balsamic glaze and add 1 tbsp olive oil. Cook until slightly browned and set aside.
4. Get out the naan bread. Put as much pizza sauce on as you would like, leaving the edges dry so it can be like the "crust" of the pizza.
5. Add the toppings (pear), herbs, and cheese if you desire. Then drizzle the balsamic glaze on top of the pizza.
6. Bake the pizza for 12-14 minutes at 350 F.
